# Python Testing

- Use `pytest` as the default test runner.
- When fixing a bug: write a failing test first, then fix.
- Keep tests deterministic (no network/time dependency by default).
- Prefer fixtures for setup/teardown; avoid shared mutable global state.
- Separate unit vs integration tests (e.g., markers like `@pytest.mark.integration`).
